This session will provide insights into the practical applications of these tools, showcasing how they can be leveraged to streamline workflows, enhance data analysis, and support decision-making processes. You'll gain a deeper understanding of how low-code/no-code platforms complement traditional SQL, enabling analysts to deliver results efficiently and effectively.

domo.com," As a business owner, you know that automation can be a key factor to success. Automating common business processes can help your employees work more effectively and efficiently. But what about automation of your data? That’s where business intelligence (BI) tools come in. BI tools can help you automate the gathering and analysis of data, so you can make better decisions for your business. In this article, we will discuss how BI tools can help automate your business and make it more efficient.
 

 
What business intelligence (BI) tools are and how they can help your business
Business intelligence (BI) refers to the tools and processes a business uses to create intelligent insights from its business data. It involves the collection, storage, transformation, and visualization of that data to end-users.
Automation is a critical aspect of any BI tool, as it helps minimize the amount of manual work your team performs. With the right BI tool, you are able to put your data to work faster than ever before. Processes that used to take days or even weeks can be streamlined down to hours or even minutes, thanks to the power of automation with BI.
 
The benefits of automating your business with BI tools
BI tools take data from multiple sources and automate the collection of that data on a daily basis. Automated data collection also ensures accuracy and consistency in your data. Identify trends and patterns in your business, so you can make better decisions for the future. Having accurate and up-to-date information at the precise moment you need it is critical to the success of your business.
Another great benefit of BI tools is the automation of data analysis. With the help of algorithms and formulas, BI tools can automatically analyze your data and present it in an easy-to-understand format. This can help you quickly understand important trends in your data to help you make better business decisions.
One of the biggest benefits of using BI tools is the automation of data visualization through dashboards. Data dashboards are the final presentation of data through the use of charts, graphs, summary numbers, and key performance indicators (KPIs). BI tools can automatically update reports and dashboards with new data as soon as it enters the system. This can be extremely useful when making critical business decisions. Up-to-date data can be at your fingertips with just a few short clicks.
 
How to choose the right BI tool to automate your business
When looking at different BI tools, it’s important to find a vendor that focuses on data automation. BI can be quite a complex and often manual process with the wrong tool. 
Modern BI tools can automate almost every aspect of the data process for your business. Make sure to choose a vendor that is capable of automating data collection, processing, storage, and visualization. Emphasizing the importance of automation for your company is essential when talking with a BI vendor.
 
The challenges you may face when using BI tools and how to overcome them
Automation can be quite complex when implemented the wrong way. With BI, it doesn’t have to be. One of the great aspects of BI tools is that they are built for the everyday business user in mind, meaning they are incredibly intuitive and easy to use.
An important consideration when using a BI tool to automate your business is to make sure you have the right tools and credentials to access the data. Data can be stored in a variety of formats and systems: spreadsheets, databases, or software tools. Data integration is the most technical aspect of BI and will require the support of IT teams. Making sure IT is on board and able to assist with these introductory processes is critical. As you start using the BI tool, IT will realize just how helpful it is in the automating routine processes for which they used to be responsible. 
Automation will also require the full buy-in of your team—from executives down to individual contributors. Help employees understand that automation is not going to take away their jobs, but rather allow them to be more efficient and productive at work. Too much time is spent on mundane tasks such as data entry. By using a BI tool, your business users will have more time in the day to do what they’re best at.
 

 
Case studies of businesses automating processes with BI
Automation can benefit many aspects of your business, no matter how big or small it is. We’ll now explore a few different use cases where automation can streamline business processes.
Automating data entry between systems
Routine data entry between business systems is a common process used by businesses of all sizes. Many companies even have data entry positions where workers are dedicated full-time to the task. 
BI tools can help automate this data entry by integrating data sources together through a write-back connection. Data write-back is the process in which data is transferred automatically from one system to another. BI tools can connect hundreds of different systems together, automating data entry so that your employees can focus on more critical tasks.
Automating financial reporting
BI tools can also automate critical financial reporting processes. Companies of all sizes need to report on their financial health, whether that’s on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. By using a BI tool, data from financial reports can be generated automatically each month. Finance and accounting teams who traditionally were buried in spreadsheets can use a BI tool to create automated processes for reconciliation, financial statements such as balance sheets and income statements, and other routine bookkeeping tasks.
Automating alerts and notifications
BI tools can also be used to create custom notifications or alerts to notify your team when business exceptions occur. Instead of relying on employees manually sending emails anytime an error occurs, your BI tool can automate all types of communications. Managers and leaders can receive text messages, phone calls, or push notifications to their mobile devices anytime something changes within the business. 
 
Conclusion
BI tools are a great way to automate the gathering and analysis of data. If you’re not currently using a BI tool in your business, now is the time to consider implementing one. By automating this process, you’ll free up valuable time for your employees to focus on other important tasks. ",competition

domo.com," Social media has become a powerful tool for brands to reach their audiences. But in order to be successful, it requires an investment of time and money that yields the best ROI when combined with a data-driven approach.
The most important aspect of social media is understanding which channels are right for your business objectives: some people work better on Facebook, others prefer Twitter, and still others are more successful with LinkedIn. Once you understand your target market and the social media platforms they use, it’s time to start advertising.
Facebook Ads is one of the most popular social media advertising platforms. It offers businesses a wide range of targeting options, including demographics, interests, behaviors, and more. Facebook Ads also allows businesses to target their ads by location, which is important for local businesses.
But in order to get the most out of Facebook Ads, you need to track your data and analyze it using BI tools. A Facebook Ads dashboard can help you do just that.
 

 
In this article, we are going to take a look at what a Facebook Ads dashboard is, why you should build one, and the benefits of using BI tools to analyze your data. We will answer the top questions business owners have about Facebook Ads dashboards, such as:

What are the benefits of using a BI tool to create a Facebook Ads dashboard?
How can I use a BI tool to analyze my Facebook Ads data?
Can I create a Facebook Ads dashboard without using a BI tool?

And finally, we will provide practical steps for how to build your own Facebook Ads dashboard using BI tools.
First, let’s take a look at what Facebook Ads are, and how they work.
 
What are Facebook Ads?
Facebook Ads is a form of online advertising that allows businesses to target their ads to specific audiences on Facebook. Facebook Ads can be targeted by demographics (gender, age, location, etc.), interests, behaviors, and more.
 
How do Facebook Ads work?
When you create a Facebook Ads campaign, you will create one or more ad(s) that will be displayed to Facebook users who meet the targeting criteria you set.
You will also set a budget for your campaign, and choose how you want to pay for your ads (CPC, CPM, etc.). When someone clicks on your ad, they will be redirected to the landing page you set up.
With Facebook Ads, brands can reach a large and diverse audience with their marketing messages. But in order to be successful, it’s important to track your data and use BI tools to analyze it.
So why should you build a Facebook Ads dashboard using BI tools? Let’s take a look at some of the benefits.
1. Increased ROI
ROI is one of the most important metrics for businesses to track. By using BI tools to analyze your Facebook Ads data, you can ensure that each dollar you spend on advertising is yielding the best possible return.
2. Better understanding of your target market
The more you know about your target market, the better you can tailor your marketing messages to appeal to them. BI tools can help you identify your target market’s demographics, interests, and behaviors.
3. Improved targeting
Facebook Ads allows businesses to target their ads by location, age, gender, interests, and more. But you can’t take full advantage of these targeting options unless you track your data and use BI tools to analyze it.
4. Insight into your competition
BI tools can also help you track your competition’s Facebook Ads campaigns. This can give you insights into what strategies they’re using, what ads are working well for them, and more.
5. Increased efficiency
By tracking your data and using BI tools to analyze it, you can identify which Facebook Ads campaigns are performing the best and which ones need to be tweaked or discontinued. This can help you save time and money by focusing your advertising efforts on the campaigns that are most likely to succeed.
6. Seasonal trends
Facebook Ads data can also be used to track seasonal trends. For example, you may find that your sales dip in the summer months. By tracking this data using BI tools, you can plan your advertising campaigns accordingly.
Now that we’ve answered some of the top questions business owners have about Facebook Ads dashboards, let’s take a look at how to create one.
 
How to create a Facebook Ads dashboard using BI tools
There are a number of BI tools that you can use to create a Facebook Ads dashboard. The ultimate goal should be to create a dashboard that provides you with an at-a-glance overview of your Facebook Ads data.
Here are some steps for how to create a Facebook Ads dashboard using BI tools:
1. Know the KPI goals of your business
The first step in creating a Facebook Ads dashboard is to know the KPI goals of your business. What are the key performance indicators that you want to track? These can include things like ROI, conversion rates, website visits, and more.
With the right KPIs in place, you can better track the success of your Facebook Ads campaigns. This will ensure that you’re getting the most out of your advertising dollars.
2. Collect Facebook Ads data
The second step is to collect Facebook Ads data. This data can come from your own Facebook Ads account, or you can use a BI tool to import it from other sources (such as Google Analytics or your CRM).
The data you collect will feed into the dashboard you create. So make sure to collect data on a regular basis so that your dashboard is always up-to-date. This may require you to set up an automated data collection process.
If you aren’t recording your Facebook Ads data – or aren’t sure how to begin – your BI tool will give you the ability to track all of your data and create customizable dashboards.
3. Create a dashboard in BI tools
The third step is to use your BI tool to create a Facebook Ads dashboard. This dashboard should provide you with an at-a-glance overview of your Facebook Ads data.
Your dashboard should include graphs and charts that show how your Facebook Ads campaigns are performing. It should also include data on things like website visits, conversion rates, and ROI.
You can customize your dashboard to meet the specific needs of your business. So if you want to track additional KPIs, you can easily do so.
Here are some examples of visualization tools that you can use in your Facebook Ads dashboard:

Pie charts: Pie charts can track the percentage of a whole that is represented by different parts. They are perfect for displaying breakup data, such as the breakup of revenue by product line or marketing campaign.
Bar charts: Bar charts are used to compare values between different items. They are perfect for tracking things like website visits, conversion rates, and ROI.
Line graphs: Line graphs are used to track trends over time. They are perfect for displaying data such as website visits, conversion rates, and ROI.

 

 
4. Share the dashboard with stakeholders
Once you have created your Facebook Ads dashboard, you need to share it with stakeholders. This includes people within your business who need access to Facebook Ads data, such as marketing managers and executives.
Make sure that the dashboard is easy to understand so that everyone can quickly glean insights from it.
The best way to share your dashboard is by embedding it in a website or sending it as an email. You can also print it out for physical distribution.
5. Monitor the dashboard and make adjustments as needed
The final step is to monitor the Facebook Ads dashboard and make adjustments as needed. If one of your KPIs isn’t meeting your expectations, then you need to take action.
This may mean adjusting your campaign goals or changing your targeting criteria. It may also mean tweaking your ad copy or creatives.
The key is to be proactive and make changes as soon as necessary. This will help you to achieve the best results from your Facebook Ads campaigns.
6. Utilize your Facebook Ads dashboards to make informed decisions
A Facebook Ads dashboard is a great way to track the performance of your campaigns. But it’s also much more than that.
A dashboard can help you make informed decisions about your business. It can help you understand which marketing channels are working best for you and which ones need improvement.
The bottom line is that a Facebook Ads dashboard is a valuable business tool. So make sure to take advantage of it.
 
Conclusion
A Facebook Ads dashboard is a powerful tool that can help you track the performance of your campaigns and make informed decisions about your business. When you have the right data at your fingertips, you can save time and money while achieving better results.
By using a BI tool to create your dashboard, you can ensure that you are getting the most out of your data. So make sure to take advantage of this valuable resource. Get started today by setting up a BI tool and start running your Facebook Ads campaigns like a pro! ",social

domo.com," ETL refers to the cycle of extracting (E), transforming (T), and loading (L) data from various sources and changing the data to meet specific business rules and requirements. The data is then loaded into target storage, typically a data warehouse. ETL in data migration refers to moving data or information from one source to another. While the process of data migration might appear straightforward, it requires significant data transformation processes.
Data can be extracted from a number of sources, including:

Cloud environments, such as cloud-based CRM or ERP software
Existing databases
Legacy systems
On-premise or cloud data warehouses
Data storage platforms, solutions, or applications
Data analytics tools
Mobile devices

In the case of data integration, ETL solutions can synchronize data from one source to another. For example, when pulling data from a custom-built website to an ERP or CRM system, data is synchronized in both locations.
 

 
ETL vs. data migration vs. data integration
ETL, data migration, and data integration are all processes that involve data. However, they’re each used for specific purposes and with different methods. Understanding how each is different from the others will help you choose the right data migration approach for your business. 
Put simply, data migration and ETL processes are used when organizations are looking to understand more of their data. Additionally, both approaches entail moving data from one source to another. Data integration, on the other hand, does not involve moving information from one place to another. Instead, data is gathered from various sources for the purpose of cleansing and analyzing the gathered data. 
ETL
As previously mentioned, ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. ETL involves extracting data from one or multiple sources, cleaning it, and transforming it into an easily digestible format that can be understood across the enterprise. The data is then loaded into another database or destination. The ETL tool that extracts data from one source is also responsible for maintaining data consistency, ensuring information is accurate and up-to-date before sending it to the final destination. 
Data migration is similar to ETL as both processes move data from one information source to another. However, with data migration, the format of data does not change, whereas in ETL processes, it does. 
Data migration
IBM describes data migration as “the process of transferring data from one storage system or compute environment to another.” Data migration can take place in a few ways, including between computer systems, storage systems, or data formats. There are a number of reasons organizations may need to complete data migration projects, such as replacing on-premise servers or consolidating data centers. It’s also an essential step in migrating to a cloud environment.
One of the primary differences between data integration and data migration is that during data integration, a number of disparate data sources are brought together. Data migration, on the other hand, simply involves moving data from one place to another. 
Data integration
Data integration is the process of collecting and integrating data from internal and external systems into a single, unified view. The process begins with data ingestion, then cleanses the information, and finally maps and transforms it. More simply, data integration is a critical step in creating actionable business intelligence.
Data integration is similar to both data migration and ETL; however, data integration is typically utilized when organizations want to get more out of their existing data. Combining data sources from across the enterprise provides additional context into insights, enabling users to make better, more informed decisions.
 

 
What is the ETL data migration process?
The ETL data migration process will vary depending on the specific ETL tool being used. However, most follow a similar process:

First, the data migration is thoroughly scoped to determine stakeholders, budgets, deadlines, communication processes, and reporting requirements.
Next, resources are evaluated to determine which method and tool will be used during the process.
The migration process is planned out and testing resources are put in place.
The migration process is tested from beginning to end to ensure limitations or weaknesses are identified and resolved before migration occurs.
The data migration team begins developing the migration project. This is usually done in stages to mitigate risks before they occur.
Finally, after the go-live method is tested, the migration process is executed.

 
Use Cases and examples of ETL migration
Knowing when to use ETL migration is a critical part of using the process correctly. Below are just a few examples and use cases of when ETL migration is best utilized:
ETL in data warehousing
The most common use case of ETL is data warehousing. For example, when a client needs to bring historical data into their current warehouse, ETL tools centralize that data, providing users with easy access to critical insights.
Enabling self-service reporting
ETL tools eliminate the need for IT personnel or technical support when creating data reports. The solutions can easily extract data from across the enterprise and create data visualizations such as graphs, charts, maps, or dashboards. By democratizing data, all employees can access and analyze data to make decisions.
Provides real-time monitoring and alerts
ETL tools can create pipelines that constantly extract data from various sources and process it in real time. With real-time analysis, organizations can actively track and monitor key metrics as they’re happening, which drives business outcomes.
 

 
How to choose the right ETL tool for data migration
Not all ETL tools are created equal. When evaluating various platforms, look for solutions that are:

Flexible: With data coming from a variety of sources, you’ll want an ETL tool that is flexible enough to coordinate, merge, and change data with ease.
Cost: Price is a critical factor when evaluating ETL tools. When looking at tools, ask questions such what annual costs you’ll have to pay, does the cost go up if the amount of data sources increases, or how much will it cost to build your initial pipeline. 
Ease-of-use: Some ETL tools are designed for more technical audiences, so you’ll want to ensure you’ve considered the use cases and audiences that will be using the tool. Ensure the platform balances simplicity with capability so you can get the most from your data.

Using ETL tools to streamline and simplify data migration can be incredibly beneficial. However, prior to undergoing the process, you’ll want to ensure you’ve chosen a tool that is flexible, scalable, and powerful enough to handle your data. When you’ve selected the right tool, it’s easy to migrate data even across the most disparate of sources. This makes it possible for your entire organization to delve deep into data and make better, data-driven decisions.

ecommercepro.com," Being in online business can be challenging at times, considering the level of competition that can, at times, be involved in the endeavor. One common challenge faced by plenty of Shopify store owners is the persistent quest for a prominent position on search engine results pages (SERPs).
It’s a recurring story. You’ve invested plenty of time and effort into building your online storefront and designing compelling product pages, but your website isn’t raking in the traffic you were expecting and your metrics falling off the mark when it comes to your expectations. Now you find yourself wondering, what are your competitors doing right? What are the strategies employed by other businesses that have them securing the top-ranking positions on Google Search pages?
These questions fall squarely into the realm of SEO competitor analysis.
Conducting SEO competitor analysis is a crucial step in unlocking your website's full search engine optimization potential. By conducting strategic SEO competitor analysis, you can decipher some of the greatest strategies that successful online brands use to top the SERPS, helping you fine-tune your own SEO content for better results and more website traffic.
In this article by Ecommerce Pro, we take a look into SEO competitor analysis, its importance, and the strategies and tools you can employ to conduct your own.

What is SEO Competitor Analysis
SEO competitor analysis, also known as competitive analysis, revolves around the goal of analyzing your direct search competitors' target keywords, content strategy, backlinks, and other aspects to incorporate their most effective strategies into your own.
Instead of making guesses about the keywords to target, the content to write, or the links to establish, you can investigate the competition, and examine what is already successful for them and what they may be doing wrong.
 
Why Is SEO Competitor Analysis Important?
The goal of SEO competitor analysis is ultimately to learn about how you can improve your Shopify site’s position on the search engine results page. A competitor analysis lets you understand the strategies that work for your competitors so that you can replicate them, and understand their weaknesses so that you can maximize them to your advantage.
SEO competitor analysis is done so that you can learn about strategic actions you can improve your site position, based on data and not guesswork.
In the following section, we’ll walk you through the steps on how to conduct a competitor analysis:
1. Understand Your Goals:
Before diving into your SEO competitor analysis for your Shopify store, it's best to set some clearly defined goals.
These goals can either be aimed at learning from successful competitors or identifying the areas in which they are falling short. It's important to align your goals with your business objectives. For example, you might want to discover high-traffic topics, product-related keywords that drive conversions, or a combination of both. Keeping your goals and target audience in mind ensures that your analysis remains focused.
2. Identify Your Competitors:
Now that you have your goals in mind, start by noting the websites that rank at the top of the search engine results pages (SERPs) for your target keywords. Searching Google (and other search engines) for your primary keywords and taking note of all the top results would be the simplest and most obvious way to find your rivals.
The websites you select should be sites of brands closely related to your online business—sites that outperform you.
Pinpoint three to five direct competitors and analyze their keywords. You can find these competitors through manual keyword searches, but this may not be as accurate. You can also use tools like Semrush’s Organic Research to generate reports that identify common competitors across the keywords you rank for.
3. Compare Rankings:
Once you’ve pinpointed who your competitors are, it's time to compare their website performance with yours. Utilize tools like Semrush to analyze and find (and close) keyword gaps. To find keyword gaps, use Semrush’s Keyword Gap tool.
Here’s what you need to look for:


Missing Keywords: Your competitors rank for these keywords, but you don't. Identify whether you want to bridge the gap by creating new pages to target these keywords. These could include new blog pages, product pages, or categories.

Low-Competition Keywords: These are keywords relevant to your business that your competitors aren't targeting, think of them as gaps in the market that you can fill—this presents opportunities for you to capture less competitive market segments and dominate.

4. Review SEO Tactics:
Now that you’ve compared keyword rankings, you need to examine the various aspects of your competitor's SEO strategy to find commonalities and opportunities to improve your position.
Key factors you need to assess here include:


Content Types: Determine the predominant content type among top-ranking pages. Ask yourself how your competitors use keywords throughout the page, and analyze the quality of their writing and content.

Content Thickness: This is where you compare word, image, and video counts to evaluate your rival’s content depth. When it comes to word count, top-ranking pages usually have 1500 words, so you can work to match this.

Title Tags and Meta Descriptions: Analyze whether competitors use compelling language to boost clickthrough rates. Ask yourself whether your competitors integrate keywords better than you into their titles and meta tags.

Page Speed: Speed is important when it comes to ranking. You can use tools like Google's PageSpeed Insights to make a comparison of your page's loading speed performance against competitors.

Backlink Profile: Backlinks are links used by other websites that direct users back to their site. Analyzing backlinks is an important part of SEO competitive analysis and you can use tools like Semrush’s Backlink Analytics tool to check your competitors’ backlink profiles. This can provide insights and ideas for your own link-building strategies.

5. Make Changes Based on Insights
After conducting your competitor analysis, you'll have three actions to take from your list. First off you’ll have to develop new pages to target missing keywords. Secondly, you’ll have to create content to fill your keyword strategy. Lastly, you’ll have to improve existing content to make it more SEO-friendly and competitive in the SERPs by incorporating backlinks, meta titles, and descriptions, as well as improving site speed.
Having a targeted approach and implementing these changes based on your competitor analysis will help you improve your website's SERP rankings as well as its overall performance.
 
Conclusion
Ecommerce and selling online on Shopify can get a little competitive at times, and achieving a prominent position in the SERPs is something we all aspire for as Shopify store owners. If your website isn't attracting the desired traffic or meeting your expectations, you can always conduct an SEO competitor analysis to see what the competition is doing right, so that you’ll know which areas to improve and where to fill the gap to come up on top.
In this article, we've delved into the crucial role of SEO competitor analysis and provided an intro to conducting one effectively. It’s important to note that competitive analysis is part of an ongoing process when it comes to online business, and most shops are advised to conduct one every 6-12 months so that you can keep an eye on your competitors and keep improving your site and SEO strategy so that you emerge on top of the SERPS.

But as more data becomes available and advanced analytics are further refined, managers may struggle with when, where, and how much to incorporate machines into their business analytics, and to what extent they should bring their own judgment to bear when making data-driven decisions. In general, humans are better at decisions involving intuition and ambiguity resolution. Machines are far superior at decisions requiring deduction, granularity, and scalability. How can you find the right balance? There are three common approaches to analytics: descriptive, where decisions are made mainly by humans; predictive, which combines aspects of the other two; and prescriptive, which usually means autonomous management by machines. This article describes when and how to use each approach and examines the trade-offs and limitations. Although the focus is on marketing and sales, the principles may be applied more broadly.

Having worked in the HubSpot ecosystem for over a decade, these latest updates to data management are some of the most significant shifts I’ve seen. 

As Rowan, Huble’s CTO, points out in this clip taken from the Evolving HubSpot podcast, we’ve had the ability to sync data from HubSpot to Snowflake for a while now. 

But with the introduction of two-way sync, data can finally flow back and forth, bringing us closer to seamless connectivity with data changes across the business.

Not only that, but they've also opened up BigQuery integration for Google users.

—

Here’s why this matters for upmarket companies looking at HubSpot as a true customer data platform:

👉 HubSpot is making big strides into connecting with large data set models and software

With these moves, HubSpot is clearly positioning itself as a platform that can meet the complex needs of data-driven businesses. 

The Snowflake integration showed they’re serious about handling large data warehouses, and now with BigQuery, they’re expanding that capability to Google’s stack. 

For companies using large datasets, this is a significant advantage that makes HubSpot a much more versatile option.

As Rowan mentions, Microsoft’s Azure is likely on the horizon too - which is logical. 

HubSpot is connecting with the biggest data warehouse players, and this consistent push into high-scale integrations makes it clear they’re aiming to serve enterprise clients with real data complexity.

—

What’s next for HubSpot’s unified data vision?

If INBOUND taught us anything this year, it’s that HubSpot is fully committed to a unified data approach. 

Unified data was one of the core messages, and these integrations are proof they’re putting their money where their mouth is. 

With BigQuery and Snowflake now part of the picture, it’s clear they’re working toward being the central data hub for larger, data-focused businesses.

For teams handling data across multiple ecosystems, this connectivity investment is a welcome update.

mdpi.com," This paper presents a novel solution aimed at enhancing news web pages for seamless integration into the Semantic Web. By utilizing advanced pattern mining techniques alongside OpenAI’s GPT-3, we rewrite news articles to improve their readability and accessibility for Google News aggregators. Our approach is characterized by its methodological rigour and is evaluated through quantitative metrics, validated using Google’s Rich Results Test API to confirm adherence to Google’s structured data guidelines. In this process, a “Pass” in the Rich Results Test is taken as an indication of eligibility for rich results, demonstrating the effectiveness of our generated structured data. The impact of our work is threefold: it advances the technological integration of a substantial segment of the web into the Semantic Web, promotes the adoption of Semantic Web technologies within the news sector, and significantly enhances the discoverability of news articles in aggregator platforms. Furthermore, our solution facilitates the broader dissemination of news content to diverse audiences. This submission introduces an innovative solution substantiated by empirical evidence of its impact and methodological soundness, thereby making a significant contribution to the field of Semantic Web research, particularly in the context of news and media articles.
